# socless-visualizer-vscode
Heavily inspired by @PaulShestakov 's `aws-step-functions-constructor` plugin for VSCode, this customizes the visualization for SOCless with custom scripts to properly interpret/produce the SF tree for a SOCless playbook, color coding for errors, and eventually error checking in the UI
